# HedgeNight

## Description

A productivity application geared towards freelance workers and anyone who wishes to keep track of their time. A user can create and time a project task directly from the main page and once logged in can save tasks. Logged in users can view their task history and continue tasks selected to unpause the timer function and add to their project history.

## Installation

1. Clone repository

2. Add a .env at the top level of this project. Then inside of the .env add a SERVER_SECRET set to any value you'd like:

```
SERVER_SECRET = [your password goes here]
```

3. Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in the root directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

After all installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
